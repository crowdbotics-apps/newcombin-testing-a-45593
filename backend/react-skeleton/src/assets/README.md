# Assets

This folder contains all the assets for your app

## What goes here

In this folder you may store all your assets

- These assets should NOT contain code (CSS, TS, JS files should not live here)

## Recommendations

Keep your assets small and optimized, only import assets where they are needed.

## Naming Convention

> **Note**
> There is no strict naming convention, but you can define one for your project in this section.
> These will help your team be aligned on how files are managed

Rules:

- Make subfolders when ...
- Name your file in this pattern ...
