# Components

This folder contains two groups of components that will help you build your UI.

> **Note**
> Complete Screens live in the `src/app` folder, and should not be here.
> Those screens can be built with components inside these two groups.

## Reusable Components [`./ui`](./ui/README.md)

Simple reusable components that you can then use to build more complex interaction patterns ([Read More](./ui/README.md))

## Complex Components [`./complex`](./complex/README.md)

Complex components used for more specific use cases built from other components, these components may or may not integrate with backend queries or mutations ([Read More](./complex/README.md))
